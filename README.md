# Counter ![Total installs](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://i.pluginhub.info/shields/installs/plugin/counter)
This runelite plugin lets you manually increment or decrement a counter which displays as a box on your screen, displays a number, or displays your true tile that changes when you update the counter with hotkeys. 

The default key is the tilda ` key which is often found left of the 1 key on your keyboard but can be changed in the plugin configuration.

# Usage
Alt+click on the border of the overlay to change the size

Alt+right click on the overlay to reset to default size

# Contributions and Credits
This plugin is initially taken from https://github.com/vincent0955/Visual-metronome which provides the framework for the overlays.
