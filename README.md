# Tick Manipulation Helper

This plugin was initially created to aid tick manipulation techniques with chinchompa hunting. 
However, it can be used for other activities that involve setting up 3-tick actions or celastrus 4-tick actions.

Features can be preferably requested in a GitHub Issue or dmed to me on discord "thegoldfish".

When the action timer above your player's head shows "1" is the moment you will perform an action. 
You can trigger the action by clicking when you see the "1" as well. For example, you can use a knife on teak logs to set up a 3 tick action. 
Then click a box trap when you see "1" and the box trap will be placed.
